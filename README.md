## **Machine Learning Project: Image Classification**

In this project the MNIST dataset is used to build and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models for image classification. The goal of this project is to classify each image into one of the numbers.

### **Dataset**

The MNIST dataset includes `70,000 images` of handwritten digits (0-9) with a resolution of **28x28** pixels. The distribution of digits in the dataset is shown in a bar plot.
